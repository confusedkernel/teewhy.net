# About the Site

> **Tyler's Void** - No thoughts, head empty.

Initially started this website as some sort of portfolio, but now I just write whatever I want.

The "Void" name is inspired by "[Janet's Void](https://thegoodplace.fandom.com/wiki/The_Void)" from my favorite show *The Good Place*, also because sometimes I feel like screaming into the void when I post here.

Website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
