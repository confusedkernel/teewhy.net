## About the Site

> **Tyler's Void** - No thoughts, head empty.

Initially started this website as some sort of portfolio, but now I just write whatever I want.

The "Void" name is inspired by "[Janet's Void](https://thegoodplace.fandom.com/wiki/The_Void)" from my favorite show *The Good Place*, also because sometimes I feel like screaming into the void when I post here.

Website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).



## About Me

**Tyler** /tai¬∑lr/

he/him | üç§

A 20-something walking disaster. Code a little and listen to music... like, a lot.
I also read now, which isn't all the time. But enough to write think pieces once in a while.

Currently an undergraduate studying English and Computer Science.

Talk to me about all things music or tech and I'll be really happy.
