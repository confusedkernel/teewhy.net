## About the Site

> **Tyler's Void** - No thoughts, head empty.

Hey, thanks for stopping by! This is my personal blog. I initially started this website as a portfolio, but since then it has become a capsule of everything I love. I write about coding, music, and even books or tvs whenever I feel like I have something to say.

The "Void" name is inspired by "[Janet's Void](https://thegoodplace.fandom.com/wiki/The_Void)" from my favorite show *The Good Place*. Also... Sometimes I feel like screaming into the void when I post here, so there's that.

While you're here, you might also want to check out my friend Léana's blog [Earth 2077](https://earth2077.fr) :)

Website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).


## About Me

**Tyler** /tai·lr/

he/him | INFP-T

A 20-something walking disaster. Code a little and listen to music... like, a lot.
I also read now, which isn't all the time. But enough to write think pieces once in a while.

Currently an undergraduate studying English and Computer Science.

Talk to me about all things music or tech and I'll be really happy.
