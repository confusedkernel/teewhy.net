On October 21st, 2022, Taylor Swift dropped her highly-anticipated 10th studio album. After
                            a near radio-silence year with very few contents, I was really excited for this album.
                            And frankly, this album did not disappoint. Overall this album ensembles the concept of "13
                            Sleepless Nights,"
                            and each song has a certain sound that corresponds to her "eras." That said, I've been
                            putting the album on repeat for months
                            and I haven't been able to rank the tracks at all... until now.
