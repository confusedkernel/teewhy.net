As the final week approaches, I find myself spending more time in a library or a cafe studying. As a music addict, I wasted quite a lot of time going through my music collection trying to find the type of music that works for me as I study. After wasing too much time browsing my saved albums, I decided to branch out and discover new album and artists that I'll probably like. And this is the five album that I discovered and absolutely adored. If you're someone like me, I hope these five energetic album can help you power through your exam week!

## Nothing Lasts Forever and That's OK - Blanks (2022)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/nothing-lasts-forever-and-thats-ok-deluxe/1631158475" format="album">}}

I first discovered Blanks in 2019, back when he was blowing up for his YouTube series "Remaking Songs in 1 Hour". I remember thinking that he'd be the one to watch in the future. I stumbled upon his new album when I was shuffling through my library and found his old works. Out of curiosity I decided to check out his new album. Overall this album showed an incredible artistic growth, it's still very pop/indie pop. But it's a more matured, more cohesive, and more enjoyable project.

**Favorite Tracks** : Asking For Too Much, Turn Around

## Fever Dream - Cannons (2022)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/fever-dream/1609678268" format="album">}}

*Fever Dream* is a sonic tapestry that weaves together elements of alternative rock, electronic music, and dream pop, resulting in a unique and evocative sound. Bearing similarity to Cannons' previous works, this album managed to keep her signature sound while still feeling fresh. The album overall has a hypnotic sound, with heavy reverb and a groove to it. I love coding to this album.

**Favorite Tracks**: Bad Dream, Only You

## Calico - Ryan Beatty (2023)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/calico/1676552614" format="album">}}

This is the oddity out of these five albums. This album doesn't feature a fabulous pop production or a punchy bassline, but it's shaping up to become one of my favorite album in 2023. In contrast to other albums on this list, this album is soft. It gives off singer/songwriter vibe with Ryan Beatty's raw vocals drawing you in with emotions. Overall, this album feels like an afternoon trip to your favorite coffee shop, just studying by the window as people walk by.

**Favorite Tracks**: Bruises Off The Peach, Andromeda

## That! Feels! Good! - Jessie Ware (2023)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/that-feels-good/1668868373" format="album">}}

Continuing the triumph of her last album *What's Your Pleasure* (which is also REALLY GOOD), this album continues the groovy, funky sound of that album. This album feels really old school - like an old school dance hall. Whenever it starts playing it'll brighten up your day. Granted, this may not be the best album for studying, but it might just be what you need when you're battling a bug-ridden program.

**Favorite Tracks**: Free Yourself, Begin Again

## Dreamland - COIN (2020)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/dreamland/1485768225" format="album">}}

Better late than never I guess. In 2020, I've listened to "I Want It All" on repeat. I was obsessed with the synth-driven, funky chorus of the track. Little did I know this is an album full of that sound (and feel). If you're someone into indie pop, this album is the lofi, chill vibes of indie pop at its finest. It's upbeat with actually well-written verses. The album also feels somewhat nostalgic, like looking through a summer day in a film camera (iykyk).

**Favorite Track**: Simple Romance, Youuu
