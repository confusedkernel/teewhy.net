Before Christmas season gets into full swing, I thought I'd document some albums I've been obsessed with lately. Senior year is hectic for everyone, therefore, having a good soundtrack is more important than you think. Here are the five albums that have been on heavy rotation lately:

## 1989 (Taylor's Version) - Taylor Swift (2023)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/1989-taylors-version-deluxe/1713845538?l=en-GB" format="album">}}

Unsurprisingly, *1989 (Taylor's Version)* is one of my most played album of the month. She crashed Apple Music on release day and made me bought Spotify for a month. Her power should not be underestimated. This new rendition of what is arguably her best pop album features 5 new vault tracks. Personally, I find every song on Taylor's Version much more enjoyable than the original version in 2014. Her matured vocal and clear mix on *1989 Taylor's Version* make the songs sound a lot better. (Not to mention the drums??? They cranked up the bass and I love every single song even more.) The vault tracks are more moody and wordy - almost bearing resemblance to her 2022 album *Midnights*. "Is It Over Now" is a highlight of the vault that I just could not believe she scrapped it 9 years ago.

**Favorite Tracks**: "Is It Over Now?", "Now That We Don't Talk", "Style"

## Waiting to Spill - The Backseat Lovers (2022)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/waiting-to-spill/1639267603?l=en-GB" format="album" >}}

**The Backseat Lovers** is currently my favorite band on earth. I love the guitar indie rock style that I haven't quite found in other artists. While this album has elements of their debut album *When We Were Friends*, this album is more stripped down and intimate. The lyrics and composition also feels more matured. This album feels extremely unique and the progression of each song feels cathartic. In the lonely atmosphere that this album created, you get to wander around and stay focused.

**Favorite Tracks**: "Words I Used", "Slowing Down"

## Unreal Unearth - Hozier (2023)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/unreal-unearth/1687653476?l=en-GB" format="album" >}}

Hozier is back. Period. His albums never fail to disappoint, and *Unreal Unearth*. Though some may argue that this album doesn't sound that different from his previous albums, and it's still far from besting his epochal song "Take Me To Church" - it's still a decent album that allows you to have a good time.

**Favorite Tracks**: "De Selby (Part 2)", "All Things End"

## Stick Season - Noah Kahan (2022)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/stick-season-well-all-be-here-forever/1689703584?l=en-GB" format="album" >}}

As you can see from this list, I'm (kind of) having my indie/folk phase. I was first introduced to Noah Kahan by my best friend way back in high school, but at the time I didn't think his music was this good. Every time I listened to his previous projects, they felt like they were missing something. But *Stick Season* is a project that I thoroughly enjoyed. The lonely, bitter, and greyish feel that this album exudes makes it perfect for an autumn day. His vocal performance on this album also impressed a lot. Overall, the artistic growth is insane, and I hope he takes home a few Grammys with this album.

**Favorite Tracks**: "New Perspective", "Paul Revere", "Homesick"

## Something To Give Each Other - Troye Sivan (2023)

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/something-to-give-each-other/1694860250?l=en-GB" format="album" >}}

I love the fact that every Troye Sivan project is a pop perfection of its time. This album sounds current, fun, and interesting. It's interesting to go through his discography and experience him embracing his sexuality. It's apparent that he is healed and embraced his queerness to the fullness on the album. *Something To Give Each Other* is electric, euphoric, and vulnerable. While the second half of the album failed to continue the momentum built up in the first half, it's still an enjoyable album. This is the new standard of dance-pop album.

**Favorite Tracks**: "In My Room", "Rush"
