As the final week approaches, I find myself spending more time in a library or a cafe doing work. As a music addict, I wasted quite a lot of time going through my music collection trying to find the type of music that works for me as I study. However, I decided to branch out and discover some new artists that might be my music taste. And this is a list containing these new albums that I found. If you're someone who's into upbeat study music, these can power anyone through the hectic final week.

I first discovered Blanks in 2019, back when he was blowing up for his YouTube series "Remaking Songs in 1 Hour". I remember thinking that he'd be the one to watch in the future. I stumbled upon his new album when I was shuffling through my library and found his old works. Out of curiosity I decided to try out his new album. Overall this album showed an incredible artistic growth, it's still very pop/indie pop. But it's a more matured, more cohesive, and more enjoyable project.

## Fever Dream - Cannons (2022)

*Fever Dream* is a sonic tapestry that weaves together elements of alternative rock, electronic music, and dream pop, resulting in a unique and evocative sound. Baring similarity to Cannons' previous works, this album managed to keep her signature sound while still feeling fresh. The album overall has a hypnotic sound, with heavy reverb and a groove to it. I love coding to this album.

**Favorite Tracks**: Bad Dream, Only You

## Calico - Ryan Beatty (2023)

I didn't think this would be my type of album, but it's shaping up to become one of my favorite album in 2023. In contrast to other albums on this list, this album is soft. It gives off singer/songwriter vibe with Ryan Beatty's raw vocals drawing you in with emotions. Overall, this album feels like an afternoon trip to your favorite coffee shop, just studying by the window as people walk by.

**Favorite Tracks**: Bruises Off The Peach, Andromeda

## That! Feels! Good! - Jessie Ware (2023)

<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/that-feels-good/1668868373"></iframe>

Continuing the triumph of her last album *What's Your Pleasure* (which is also REALLY GOOD), this album continues the groovy, funky sound of that album. This album feels really old school - like an old school dance hall. Whenever it starts playing it'll brighten up your day. Granted, this may not be the best album for studying, but it might just be what you need when you're battling a bug-ridden program.

**Favorite Tracks**: Free Yourself, Begin Again

## Dreamland - COIN (2020)

Better late than never I guess. In 2020, I've listened to "I Want It All" on repeat. I was obsessed with the synth-driven, funky chorus of the track. Little did I know this is an album full of that sound (and feel). If you're someone into indie pop, this album is the lofi, chill vibes of indie pop at its finest. It's upbeat with actually well-written verses. The album also feels somewhat nostalgic, like looking through a summer day in a film camera (iykyk). 

**Favorite Track**: Simple Romance, Youuu
