For me, 2023 was a year of branching out and finding new sounds. With most of my favorite artists on hiatus (or, on an unprecedentedly successful world tour), I found myself going through playlists and discovering new artists that I would've never discovered. Although it was extremely difficult to find a middle ground between my emotional bias to an album and the objective quality of it, I compiled a list of five albums that I loved in 2023. Here is my attempt at ranking them:

## Stick Season - Noah Kahan

I've known Noah Kahan since my best friend recommended his songs to me in high school - my music taste back then was strictly pop music, so I never quite appreciated his songs. However, as "Dial Drunk" went viral on TikTok last summer, I decided to give his discography another try. With Kahan's signature singer/songwriter style, *Stick Season* was a pleasant surprise full of alt-pop and folk-pop songs. I thoroughly enjoyed the album and I think it's a great starting point for those who want to get into folk music, as it sounds like a much more pop version of *For Emma, Forever Ago*. The lonely, bitter, and greyish feel that this album exudes also makes it perfect for blasting this album on an autumn roadtrip.

But what truly makes the album shine is how relatable it is. This is an accessible album both sonically and lyrically - I can see people relating to the themes of love, loss, mental health, insecurity, and moving on in this album.

> TL;DR: Pop-infused Bon Iver meets medication and New England.

**Highlight Tracks**: "The View Between Villages", "Orange Juice"

## Bloom Mountain - Hazlett

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/bloom-mountain/1655223528?l=en-GB" format="album">}}

I discovered this album during my Noah Kahan phase last summer. As a singer/songwriter album, *Bloom Mountain* was an easy listen. The shorter tracklist also makes the album concise with no fillers in between. The haunting production combined with Hazlett's airy vocals create a unique sonic experience. Thematically, this album is similar to *Stick Season*, but sonically it's a tamer project. Listening to this album on a rainy day while reading a good book can enhance the lonely atmosphere *Bloom Mountain* offers. Personally, I find myself going back to this album whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed by college assignments and just wanting to get away from life.

> TL;DR: Sadder, younger brother of Stick Season.

**Highlight Tracks**: "Everybody Hates Me", "Oh Downhill"

## 4TH WALL - Ruel

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/4th-wall/1666715254?l=en-GB" format="album">}}

Ruel has been a fixture in my playlists since his debut in 2018. It is no surprise that his debut album made the list of my favorite albums in 2023. After five years of anticipation and three incredible EPs, *4TH WALL* lived up to the hype and it did not disappoint. Citing inspiration from "The Truman Show," this album gives off the rear-view mirror type of introspection and angst. While Ruel still excels at crafting R&B influenced pop songs and teen pop radio hits, the real stars of this album are the stripped down ballads. Songs like "JAPANESE WHISKEY", "LIE", and "SITTING IN TRAFFIC" are love at first ~~sight~~ listen for me. The production is also really good, making the album cohesive yet not repetitive.

(I also went to his 4TH WALL World Tour, which made me fall in love with this album even more.)

> TL;DR: Gut-wrenching ballads and teen-pop classics.

**Highlight Tracks**: "IF AND/OR WHEN", "SITTING IN TRAFFIC"

## Bewitched - Laufey

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/bewitched/1690607869?l=en-GB" format="album">}}

I came across Laufey after seeing the Reddit thread ["Is Laufey jazz?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/16sw2a9/is_laufey_jazz/) I guess that strictly speaking, Laufey is by no means a jazz artist. Her songs incoporate jazz style but I still think her songs are more bossa nova and traditional pop than jazz. But who cares? Genres changes and evolves over time, and nowadays each genre is becoming less and less distinguishable. What matters is that Laufey is an incredibly talented artist and her new album *Bewitched* blew my expectations out of the water. The melodic composition in *Bewitched* combining with Laufey's silky vocals creates a modern Ella Fitzgerald perfection. 

> TL;DR: A mellow bossa nova album to listen to on a moonlit night.

**Highlight Tracks**: "Haunted", "Second Best"

## Desire, I Want To Turn Into You - Caroline Polachek

{{< apple-music src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/desire-i-want-to-turn-into-you/1669095245?l=en-GB" format="album">}}

Pop is such a paradoxical genre. Pop music are often regarded as formulaic and repetitive, but the best pop albums are always those which don't follow the rules. Caroline Polachek's new album is one of those pop rule breakers. It's minimalistic production and Polachek's strong vocals make this album an alt-pop staple. While synths are still a prominent features on most of the tracks (but honestly, what pop song doesn't have synth nowadays?) the surprise lies in the inventive arrangement such as the bagpipes in "Blood and Butter." "Sunset" sees Polachek experiementing with Flamenco Pop, and it ends up being one of the best tracks on the album. I think it's safe to say that this is one of the most exciting pop albums last year, if not the entire 2020s. I can't wait to see what project she'll put out in the future.

My words can't do this album justice. Give it a listen and you'll understand.

> TL;DR: Spellbinding hooks, alt-pop album of the year.

**Highlight Tracks**: "Sunset", "Pretty In Possible"
