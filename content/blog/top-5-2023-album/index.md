For me, 2023 was a year of branching out and finding new sounds. With most of my favorite artists on hiatus (or, on an unprecedentedly successful world tour), I found myself going through playlists and discovering new artists that I would've never discovered. Here are some 2023 albums that I've enjoyed:

## 5. Bloom Mountain - Hazlett

Earlier this year, Noah Kahan's *Stick Season* 

## 4. GUTS - Olivia Rodrigo

## 3. Stick Season - Noah Kahan

## 2. Messy - Olivia Dean

## 1. Desire, I Want to Turn Into You - Caroline Polachek

## +. Honorable Mentions

### Dead Club City - Nothing But Thieves

### Unreal Unearth - Hozier

### 4TH WALL - Ruel
