For me, 2023 was a year of branching out and finding new sounds. With most of my favorite artists on hiatus (or, on an unprecedentedly successful world tour), I found myself going through playlists and discovering new artists that I would've never discovered.

## Stick Season - Noah Kahan

I've known Noah Kahan since my friend recommended his songs to me in high school, but my music taste back then was strictly pop music, so I never quite appreciated his songs. However, as "Dial Drunk" went viral on TikTok this summer, I decided to give his discography another try.

**Highlight Tracks**: "The View Between Villages", "Orange Juice"

## Bloom Mountain - Hazlett

I discovered this album after my Noah Kahan phase this summer. As a singer/songwriter album, *Bloom Mountain* offers an easy listening experience.

**Highlight Tracks**: "Everybody Hates Me", "My Skin"

## Desire, I Want To Turn Into You - Caroline Polachek

## Bewitched - Laufey

## Piggy - Peter McPoland
