Autumn is the season of cozy blankets and crunchy leaves underfoot; the return of hoodie weather and afternoon picnic days; pumpkin lattes and a good book at a nice coffee shop. As the temperature dips ever so slightly, here are five songs that have been on repeat, capturing the whimsical nature of the season.

## Sailor Song - Gigi Perez

> "I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long / I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long"
