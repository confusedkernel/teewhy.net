I've been a loyal Apple Music user since 10th grade. Aside from its seamless integration with Apple's *ecosystem*, I also find the interface cleaner and easier to navigate than Spotify. However, earlier this month, I decided to make an impulsive switch to Spotify -- for no reason at all. That said, as soon as I subscribed to Spotify, my prefrontal cortex kicked into function and asked me if it was worth it to make the switch. Being the indecisive person that I am, I decided to keep both subscriptions for a month while I figure out which one works best for me.

Now that it's been a few weeks switching back and forth between Apple Music and Spotify, I finally have an answer to the question: Which one is better?

## 1. Design

Right off the bat, it's obvious that Spotify and Apple Music design their interface very differently. The choice of the default screen upon launch reflects their respective approaches to music streaming and user engagement. Spotify's focus on the homepage shows that they focus more on algorithm-based music discovery. With the plethora of curated playlists and recommendations, Spotify tries to encourage exploring new music with a mix of songs you already know and songs they know you'll love.

While Spotify focuses on playlists and discovery - Apple Music does the opposite. This puts a strong emphasis on the user's personal music collection, including purchased songs, added playlists, and the user's music library. Apple Music base their user experience on the existing user music library instead of discovering playlists and radios. Apple Music also integrates local files better - you can buy music from iTunes or import them through your laptop, and they will show up just like other albums on the streaming service. You can also put local file and streaming tracks into the same playlist.

One reddit user said it best - Spotify's interface is like going through radio stations one after one, and Apple Music is like browsing a record shop with endless catalogs. While the preference to designs are subjective, I find Apple Music's interface more intuitive for me as a predominant album listener.
