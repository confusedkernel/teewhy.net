Whether you're a [Swiftie](https://www.dictionary.com/e/pop-culture/swiftie/) or not, it is without a doubt that ***The Tortured Poets Department*** made its way onto your screen at one point in the last two months. Swift's new album -- followed by the slogan "All's Fair in Love and Poetry" -- quickly sparked conversations online, cementing itself as one of the most anticipated albums of the 2020s. Just as expected for such a colossal music event, the controversies soon followed.

On the release day of *TTPD*, the entirety of [stan twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Twitter) (or the non-swifties side of stan twitter) seemed to be in a collective outrage over Swift's "poetry bait." Some claimed that none of the lyrics are close to "poetry."

Swift's lyrical choices have always been personal and diarial since her debut in 2006. However, on an album that seemed to emphasize poetry, her iconic writing style became fuel for critics who argued that these verses fell short of the lofty standards traditionally associated with poetry. 

Amidst the controversy surrounding Swift's lyricism on her new album, I couldn't help but ponder the age-old question of "What is poetry?" Because what *exactly* is poetry? How do we define them and draw the line between poetry and Tumblr-ready quotes?

### What is Poetry?

Earlier this year, I came across [Rupi Kaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupi_Kaur)'s poetry book *Homebody* in the bookstore. After reading the entire book in just a few hours, I was confused. Of course, the "poems" were deeply personal and raw, but I just didn't know if they could even be referred to as "poems"... To me, they felt more like random statements and quotes woven together, then formatted with random line breaks to turn them into "poems".

I see the same thing happen to critics and audience regarding Taylor's new album.
