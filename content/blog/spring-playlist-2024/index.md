Spring is delicate, yet ruthless at the same time. It's a montage of soft sunlight, clear skies, fresh flowers, and the smell of grass after rain. Whether it's the quiet ambiance of a cafÃ© study session or the leisurely charm of an afternoon picnic, these five songs have etched themselves into the soundtrack of my season.

## Would That I - Hozier

> "True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree / A willow dancing on air before covering me / Under cotton and calicoes / Over canopy dapple long ago..."

## Saturn - SZA

> "If there's a point to losing love / Repeating pain (why?) / It's all the same / I hate this place"

## Tangerine - Noah Richardson

> "Your hair still stuck in my bedsheets / Your scent sweet like tangerine / Doing what I can do to come clean / Addicted to you and your misery"

## Slut! - Taylor Swift

> "Flamingo pink / Sunrise boulevard / Clink, clink / Being this young is art"

## Jupiter - Matt Maltese

> "I need you like a shore needs a rock / Jupiter couldn't keep me from you / Oh, I'm yours"
