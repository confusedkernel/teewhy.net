**“What is grief?”** To me, I consider it something we know all too well, yet all too little about. As we grow older, we learn to grapple with grief and coexist with it until our last breath; We know grief by its definition, we memorize the five stages of grief as it becomes embedded in our everyday lives - but I think that most of us never truly understand the ways in which it manifests, or how to navigate through the labyrinth of grief.

During the pandemic, like many others, I turned to television for comfort and answers. I believe that TV shows and movies are by design a mirror of the human experience - capturing the vast spectrum of emotions that shape our lives. Yet, in a time when so many of us were grappling with grief, I was surprised to find that this emotion was not really explored in television. When it is, it's rarely the focal point of the narrative. And this might be a hot take, but...

> **Even when grief does take center stage, it's often mishandled.**

What struck me as peculiar about the portrayal of grief in media was how frequently it misses the mark. This can generally be boiled down to three problems.

First, the depiction of loss is often oversimplified. More often than not, we see loss represented in a brief montage: a death, followed by a sad group of people dressed in black at a cemetery, and then it's over. This simplification downplays the profound impact of grief. When a show moves on from loss in just a few minutes, condensing the stages of grief into a short sequence, it implies that grief is something easily overcome. But isn't that the furthest from the truth?

This rushed portrayal neglects the aftermath, which is where grief truly takes hold. It's in the long, silent moments after the funeral, in the days and weeks that follow, where grief sets in and seeps into day-to-day lives. But this part of the story is often dismissed, leaving us with an incomplete and unrealistic understanding of what it means to mourn.

This oversimplification of grief in media often leads to a *wonky* perception of what it means to experience loss. But not all shows fall into this trap. There are rare instances where grief is explored with the care and complexity it deserves, where it isn’t just a subplot but the driving force of the narrative. One such example is a show we've already come to know and love: **Marvel's *WandaVision***.

*WandaVision* is, at its core, a story about grief, masterfully concealed beneath the Marvel layers of superheroes and witchcraft storyline. Wanda’s grief is manifested in the form of an idyllic sitcom world, where she creates a perfect life with a perfect family. This twisted reality serves as a poignant reminder of ***how grief can drive people to seek solace in fantasy and denial***.

*WandaVision*'s unique setting not only stands out in its genre but also allows the show to explore grief in a fresh and impactful way. Unlike typical superhero stories where trauma and struggles of the protagonist are often downplayed or glossed over, WandaVision peels back the layers of glamor to reveal that beneath the superpowers, these heroes face the same problems as ordinary people. Wanda’s grief isn’t just a subplot; it’s the heart of the story, offering a fresh take on the superhero formula, which is rare in this genre.

As we embark on the journey with Wanda, we're reminded of how the human mind copes with grief in extreme ways. Fueled by the pain of losing her parents, sibling, and the love of her life, we witness Wanda construct Westview - a vivid illustration of how people might create elaborate fantasies or distort reality as a means of escaping their pain. Wanda’s creation of the Westview sitcom world exemplifies this coping mechanism, showing the lengths to which someone might go to avoid confronting their grief directly. However, as the series go on, and we watch the fictional world unravels and falls apart, we're once again reminded that these delusions can only be sustained for so long before reality inevitably breaks through.

*WandaVision* also sheds light on a crucial aspect of grief: how our pain can unknowingly affect those around us. Wanda’s actions, driven by her sorrow, impact not only her own life but also the lives of the residents of Westview. She forces them to live in the world she’s created through mind control, her nightmares seeping into their dreams. This illustrates how, in our struggle with grief, we often make mistakes and inadvertently hurt others, sometimes without even realizing it. We might say things we don’t mean or take actions we later regret, all while trying to navigate our own suffering.

But one of my favorite scenes in the show is when Wanda, despite her own struggles, lectures her children about the nature of death and how to approach grief. She is acutely aware of the irony as she talks about how running away from the overwhelming emotions simply is not how grief works. It's moments like this that make *WandaVision* special - it highlights the common struggle we face in grief, where we become paradoxical beings, grappling with the very rules we preach while simultaneously breaking them in an attempt to cope with our own pain. However, every time we acknowledge our faults, no matter implicitly or explicitly, we also move one step closer to acceptance.

> "I am trying to tell you that there are rules in life, okay? We can't rush aging just because it's convenient. And we can't reverse death. No matter how sad it makes us. Some things are forever."

Another show that explores grief with the nuance and grace it deserves is ***Fleabag***. While WandaVision gives us a dramatic rendition of grief, Fleabag approaches it in an introspective, grounded way. The show follows the titular protagonist, Fleabag, as she navigates life while grappling with the grief of losing her best friend, Boo, and her mother. Throughout the series, we see Fleabag hiding her pain behind dark humor, her interactions with the audience, and hilarious antics. All these self-sabotaging behaviors serve as a reminder that grief can manifest in subtle ways, often remaining unacknowledged.

While my words may not fully capture the brilliance of *Fleabag*, I still highly recommend anyone who hasn’t watched it to give it a chance. The true magic lies in the way Fleabag engages with the viewer - in the unspoken moments and the nuances between the lines that make the show so deeply impactful.

I love that *Fleabag* is unafraid to show us that grieving can be ugly and messy. Beneath all the comedy and antics, the audience can see the pain and grief that drive these decisions, and the tapestry of emotions that are intertwined in her actions. People grieve in different ways, and *Fleabag* makes it known that everyone processes their pain and loss differently. Each of them could be viewed as 'problematic' in their own ways - Yet, there’s no right or wrong way to grieve in real life; it’s simply how these emotions shape us, whether we’re aware of it or not. The show excels in its seamless mix of humor and devastation, of delusions and truths. After all, life is rarely black or white, but rather shades of grey. It’s in the combination and contradiction of these elements that makes Fleabag truly exceptional, capturing the complexity of the human experience in a way that feels both authentic and deeply relatable.

The notion that we're supposed to grieve for a certain period of time before returning to *normal* is a misconception. We're told to move on, to put our feelings in a box and push them aside. *Fleabag* paints us a more realistic picture of grieving - as scary as it sounds, there isn't a world where loss affects us only for a limited time. Grieving is an ongoing process without a definitive end. Through Fleabag's flashbacks, actions, and daily interactions, we see how these losses permeate everyday life, creating a new, albeit altered, sense of normal. We see Fleabag gradually weathers her own pain, through the unspoken truth behind her actions. We witness how she goes from shoving down her feelings with humor to truthfully embracing the relationships even if they'd hurt. The pain remains, often just beneath the surface - sometimes it stings, other times it stokes a blazing fire. Yet, Fleabag finds a way to make peace with it. And isn’t that the most important lesson about grief?

I came across an article titled ["Grief, or, the Afterlife of Love"](https://celluloidblogsite.wordpress.com/2023/02/12/grief-or-the-afterlife-of-love-fleabags-version/) a few days ago, and I couldn't help but think - isn't this what grief is all about? At the heart of it all — grief and love often are inextricably linked, that the depth of our grief is a reflection of the depth of our love. 

> "I think you know how to love better than any of us, that's why you find it all so painful."

It’s this exploration of the bittersweet connection between the two that makes Fleabag so profoundly moving and special. Throughout the entirety of season two, we see the love and grief that influenced Fleabag's decision at every turn. We see it in Fleabag's unconditional support for her sister, her week-long forbidden relationship with the Priest, and her keeping the cafe afloat, these elements are intertwined with her journey. Resisting the pain from lost relationships can lead us away from our truth, but Fleabag gradually realizes this. She decides to forge a new path, not to avoid the pain but to embrace it. **Although the path is challenging, it is no longer driven by fear - but is instead built on love and the silver lining of hope.**

Grief is the manifestation of displaced love - rather than viewing it as a negative emotion, it should be seen as a testament to the deep connections we’ve had with whatever or whoever we’re grieving for, it changes the way we approach our pain. Grief, in this light, becomes a reflection of the love we’ve experienced — its intensity is a measure of the bond that has been lost. And because of that, love is also the way forward to coexist and accept grief as it is. It reminds me of Vision's words in WandaVision: **"What is grief, if not love, persevering?"**

I kept thinking back to the speech the Priest gave in the final moments of *Fleabag*. 

> “Love is awful. It’s awful. It’s painful. It’s frightening. It takes strength to know what’s right... Being a romantic takes a hell of a lot of hope. I think what they mean is, when you find somebody that you love, it feels like hope.”

Once we understand grief as a form of love, what remains is hope. The connections we make is bound to be painful, whether we like it or not — but they are all we’ve got, they are all we live for. After all, that’s just what the human experience is, isn’t it? We're born to love, to lose, and to learn. The process will undoubtly be painful, but it is this pain that underscores the depth of our connections. Time after time, we choose to embrace these bonds for the hope of it all. It is this hope that keeps us going, allowing us to dive headfirst into relationships despite the heartache - because it is this swirl of love and loss that shapes our lives and gives them meaning.
