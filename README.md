This is a repo of my site, you can see it live [here](https://teewhy.net).
Powered by Hugo and Hextra.

#### Some adjustments
- Added `tags` and `categories` taxonomies function missing from the original Hextra theme, my fork is [here](https://github.com/nottyl/hextra).
- Adjusted the layout accordingly, please check the `/layout` folder for new layout files.
