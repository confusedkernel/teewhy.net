      <content>&lt;p&gt;As the final week approaches, I find myself spending more time in a library or a cafe studying. As a music addict, I wasted quite a lot of time going through my music collection trying to find the type of music that works for me as I study. After wasing too much time browsing my saved albums, I decided to branch out and discover new album and artists that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably like. And this is the five album that I discovered and absolutely adored. If you&amp;rsquo;re someone like me, I hope these five energetic album can help you power through your exam week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;nothing-lasts-forever-and-thats-ok---blanks-2022&#34;&gt;Nothing Lasts Forever and That&amp;rsquo;s OK - Blanks (2022)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/nothing-lasts-forever-and-thats-ok-deluxe/1631158475&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I first discovered Blanks in 2019, back when he was blowing up for his YouTube series &amp;ldquo;Remaking Songs in 1 Hour&amp;rdquo;. I remember thinking that he&amp;rsquo;d be the one to watch in the future. I stumbled upon his new album when I was shuffling through my library and found his old works. Out of curiosity I decided to check out his new album. Overall this album showed an incredible artistic growth, it&amp;rsquo;s still very pop/indie pop. But it&amp;rsquo;s a more matured, more cohesive, and more enjoyable project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt; : Asking For Too Much, Turn Around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fever-dream---cannons-2022&#34;&gt;Fever Dream - Cannons (2022)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/fever-dream/1609678268&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fever Dream&lt;/em&gt; is a sonic tapestry that weaves together elements of alternative rock, electronic music, and dream pop, resulting in a unique and evocative sound. Bearing similarity to Cannons&amp;rsquo; previous works, this album managed to keep her signature sound while still feeling fresh. The album overall has a hypnotic sound, with heavy reverb and a groove to it. I love coding to this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Bad Dream, Only You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calico---ryan-beatty-2023&#34;&gt;Calico - Ryan Beatty (2023)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/calico/1676552614&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the oddity out of these five albums. This album doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature a fabulous pop production or a punchy bassline, but it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up to become one of my favorite album in 2023. In contrast to other albums on this list, this album is soft. It gives off singer/songwriter vibe with Ryan Beatty&amp;rsquo;s raw vocals drawing you in with emotions. Overall, this album feels like an afternoon trip to your favorite coffee shop, just studying by the window as people walk by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Bruises Off The Peach, Andromeda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;that-feels-good---jessie-ware-2023&#34;&gt;That! Feels! Good! - Jessie Ware (2023)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/that-feels-good/1668868373&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Continuing the triumph of her last album &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Your Pleasure&lt;/em&gt; (which is also REALLY GOOD), this album continues the groovy, funky sound of that album. This album feels really old school - like an old school dance hall. Whenever it starts playing it&amp;rsquo;ll brighten up your day. Granted, this may not be the best album for studying, but it might just be what you need when you&amp;rsquo;re battling a bug-ridden program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Free Yourself, Begin Again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dreamland---coin-2020&#34;&gt;Dreamland - COIN (2020)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/dreamland/1485768225&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Better late than never I guess. In 2020, I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to &amp;ldquo;I Want It All&amp;rdquo; on repeat. I was obsessed with the synth-driven, funky chorus of the track. Little did I know this is an album full of that sound (and feel). If you&amp;rsquo;re someone into indie pop, this album is the lofi, chill vibes of indie pop at its finest. It&amp;rsquo;s upbeat with actually well-written verses. The album also feels somewhat nostalgic, like looking through a summer day in a film camera (iykyk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Track&lt;/strong&gt;: Simple Romance, Youuu&lt;/p&gt;
