      <description>On October 21st, 2022, Taylor Swift dropped her highly-anticipated 10th studio album. After a near radio-silence year with very few contents, I was really excited for this album. And frankly, this album did not disappoint. Overall this album ensembles the concept of &amp;ldquo;13 Sleepless Nights,&amp;rdquo; and each song has a certain sound that corresponds to her &amp;ldquo;eras.&amp;rdquo; That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting the album on repeat for months and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to rank the tracks at all&amp;hellip; until now.</description>
