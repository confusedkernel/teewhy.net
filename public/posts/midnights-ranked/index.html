  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>On October 21st, 2022, Taylor Swift dropped her highly-anticipated 10th studio album. After a near radio-silence year with very few contents, I was really excited for this album. And frankly speaking, this album did not disappoint. Overall this album encapsulates the concept of &ldquo;13 Sleepless Nights,&rdquo; and each song has a certain sound that corresponds to her &ldquo;eras.&rdquo; That said, I&rsquo;ve been putting the album on repeat for months and I haven&rsquo;t been able to rank the tracks at all&hellip; until now.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2023.06.08</strong>: A lot has happened since I first wrote this on my old website, therefore, I decided to include new tracks that just dropped a few days ago!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="24-paris">24. Paris<a href="#24-paris" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySZGZrcqvr4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t even know why this track is on the album. It does not fit the theme and sonically it is the weakest song on the album. I think this track is another love letter to her current (update: they broke up) boyfriend Joe Alwyn. While it has some lyrical highlights, as well as the viral meme-ified lyrics <em>&ldquo;Tom pdom pdem alleyways&rdquo; (Stumble down pretend alleyways)</em>, it falls short when compared to other songs such as Lover, Delicate, or even some other tracks on this album.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="23-sweet-nothing">23. Sweet Nothing<a href="#23-sweet-nothing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn0brgg2BpI" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>You might think that I just hate happy songs (maybe I am). But <em>Sweet Nothing</em>, yet another track dedicated to her boyfriend (who once again appeared in songwriting credits as William Bowery, served as the quiet, intimate ballad of the album. In this track, Taylor described the security and privacy she found in her relationship. It&rsquo;s not a bad song, but the majority of the album outshines this track.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2023.06.08</strong>: This song did not age well at all.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="22-glitch">22. Glitch<a href="#22-glitch" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2a73EvnZ4s" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>As Swift&rsquo;s shortest song in her catalog, <em>Glitch</em> is a track that received mixed reviews on the album. On first listen, the arrangement of the track could give people whiplash. While it did grow on me after a few listens, it has aged badly for me. Its lyrics are not remarkable (though still better than 90% of the pop songs), and the production sees Taylor Swift experimenting in a new subgenre.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="21-mastermind">21. Mastermind<a href="#21-mastermind" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmz1lz0zcLQ" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>RIP to <em>&ldquo;I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this.&rdquo;</em> - (Paper Rings, 2019). In the closing track of <em>Midnights</em>, Swift confesses that nothing about their relationship was accidental. She is the mastermind behind all of it. The song then took an unexpected plot twist at the end - <em>&ldquo;Saw a wide smirk on your face, you knew the entire time. You knew that I&rsquo;m a mastermind.&rdquo;</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="20-karma-ft-ice-spice">20. Karma ft. Ice Spice<a href="#20-karma-ft-ice-spice" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XzOvgu3GPwY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This is not a bad song, but the new beat on the second verse makes the song feel like it&rsquo; less energetic than it should have been. I still love the remix part and genrally loved Ice Spice&rsquo;s energy on this track, but I think it would&rsquo;ve been so much better if they had just sticked with the original beat. Also, can we talk about the first lyrics? <em>&ldquo;Karma is that girl like&hellip; Grrah.&rdquo;</em> So unserious, I love it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="19-snow-on-the-beach-ft-lana-del-rey">19. Snow on the Beach ft. Lana Del Rey<a href="#19-snow-on-the-beach-ft-lana-del-rey" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ycE7bUq3-2k" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This little ranking has more lines than Lana Del Rey&rsquo;s entire verse on this song. I have to complain about this one because their voice blends beautifully, yet in another Swift fashion, Lana Del Rey got the backing vocals treatment on <em>Snow on the Beach</em>. And now I&rsquo;m just left wondering about what would&rsquo;ve, could&rsquo;ve, should&rsquo;ve been. (Shout out to Dylan O&rsquo;Brien for the drums though.)</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="18-high-infidelity">18. High Infidelity<a href="#18-high-infidelity" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qee6dFKlw4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This song gives me mixed feelings. I think this is a track that would&rsquo;ve been amazing on her folk projects such as <em>evermore</em>, embracing the heavy infidelity theme of the album&hellip; But as a bonus track on the pop record - it just doesn&rsquo;t hit as much as it would&rsquo;ve. There are tracks that are a lot stronger than <em>High Infidelity</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="17-vigilante-shit">17. Vigilante Shit<a href="#17-vigilante-shit" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Taylor Swift unleashes her &ldquo;reputation&rdquo; persona on this track and gives us a glimpse of what&rsquo;s to come in the <em>Reputation (Taylor&rsquo;s Version)</em> vault tracks. This track sounds like a twin sister to her 2017 hit <em>Look What You Made Me Do</em>, but more violent and vengeful. Its minimal production is well-executed, and the lyrics hit her adversary in every spot that hurts.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="16-snow-on-the-beach-ft-more-lana-del-rey">16. Snow on the Beach ft. More Lana Del Rey<a href="#16-snow-on-the-beach-ft-more-lana-del-rey" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

</div>

<p>No words. I don&rsquo;t have anything else to say. Lana Del Rey is truly the artist you&rsquo;ll see once in a lifetime. If you get it, you get it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="15-bejeweled">15. Bejeweled<a href="#15-bejeweled" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Now. This song truly feels like a throwback to her sleepless nights. This is her &ldquo;glitter gel pen&rdquo; at its prime. The lyrics are fun yet sophisticated (unlike a certain lead single on her 7th studio album&hellip;) This song gives off <em>1989</em> vibes and it feels like a more confident version of the <em>folklore</em> track &ldquo;mirrorball&rdquo;. &ldquo;<em>Best believe I&rsquo;m still bejeweled, when I walk in a room, I can still make the whole place shimmer.</em>&rdquo; Yes you absolutely can!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="14-bigger-than-the-whole-sky">14. Bigger Than The Whole Sky<a href="#14-bigger-than-the-whole-sky" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

</div>

<p>This song is officially the saddest song she has ever written. &ldquo;Bigger Than The Whole Sky&rdquo; talks about grief and losing something very precious to you. The greatest thing about her songwriting is that even though everyone had a different story, they all relate to this song and use it as a way to express their feelings. The best (and most heart-breaking) line happens in the second verse, &ldquo;<em>Did some bird flap its wing over in Asia? Did some force take you because I didn&rsquo;t pray?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="13-hits-different">13. Hits Different<a href="#13-hits-different" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

</div>

<p>The song that was Target Exclusive for six months are finally available on streaming platforms. Honestly, just like Paris, I don&rsquo;t know why this track is on this album, but the catchy hook, the clever lyrics makes up for the oddity in the production. <em>&ldquo;I pictured you with other girls in love, then threw up on the street.&rdquo;</em> She is so real for that.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="12-dear-reader">12. Dear Reader<a href="#12-dear-reader" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0Jti9F-oQA" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Reader&rdquo; is the most underrated track on the album. It wasn&rsquo;t catchy at first listen, but it ages like a fine wine with every listen. It is by far her best closing track, and the lyrics are top tier. &ldquo;<em>Never take advice from someone who&rsquo;s falling apart.</em>&rdquo; combined with the auto-tune to insinuate that she hides away her broken self. I adore this song.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="11-labyrinth">11. Labyrinth<a href="#11-labyrinth" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTXsKMXUi7w" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Labyrinth&rdquo; is a very interesting song. It&rsquo;s not as catchy as the other tracks, but it&rsquo;s a highlight of the album nonetheless. One thing that I admire about this track is the way Swift tweaks the same line to represent feelings of falling in love - &ldquo;<em>Uh oh, I&rsquo;m falling in love.</em>&rdquo; shows the surprise and the realization; &ldquo;<em>Oh no, I&rsquo;m falling in love again.</em>&rdquo; illustrates the fear of falling in love; and finally, &ldquo;<em>Oh, I&rsquo;m falling in love.</em>&rdquo; feels like acceptance and knowing that it&rsquo;ll be different this time around.</p>

</div>

<p>You think Jake Gyllenhaal had it bad during <em>Red (Taylor&rsquo;s Version)</em>? Wait until you hear this track. Fans have been speculating that this song is about her infamous ex John Mayer. The <em>Speak Now</em> production of this track further cemented Swiftie&rsquo;s theory. In my opinion, this is a much more gut-wrenching song than &ldquo;All Too Well&rdquo;, and the lyrics were genius. Even though the title was &ldquo;Would&rsquo;ve, Could&rsquo;ve, Should&rsquo;ve&rdquo;, she did not sing &ldquo;should&rsquo;ve&rdquo; at all during the chorus - because she sang them all in the <em>Speak Now</em> fan favorite &ldquo;Dear John.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="9-youre-on-your-own-kid">9. You&rsquo;re on Your Own, Kid<a href="#9-youre-on-your-own-kid" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

</div>

<p>Feels familiar? Taylor Swift had already hinted the track title during her NYU commencement speech in May. This is not the saddest track 5 in Taylor&rsquo;s discography. Yet it is her most prolific track 5 ever. In &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on Your Own, Kid&rdquo;, Taylor talks about her past, hardships, and a hopeful attitude towards the future. The best thing about this song is the way she used the same phrase, yet the meaning of it is the polar opposite. Have a listen, and you&rsquo;ll understand what I meant.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="8-anti-hero">8. Anti-Hero<a href="#8-anti-hero" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XqN2qFvY64U" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>This song is for the depressed kids who like to make fun of their own situation and dance to pop songs. &ldquo;Anti-Hero&rdquo; sees Taylor Swift confess her own insecurity - from the lyrics &ldquo;<em>Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby, and I&rsquo;m a monster on the hill.</em>&rdquo; to the infamous &ldquo;fat&rdquo; scene in the music video (it is totally valid and it isn&rsquo;t fatphobic, by the way.) It&rsquo;s a feel-good song sonically and a comforting song lyrically - who doesn&rsquo;t love a combo like this?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-karma">7. Karma<a href="#7-karma" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>Sorry to all the &ldquo;Karma the scrapped album&rdquo; truthers, it doesn&rsquo;t exist. But &ldquo;Karma the ultimate pop anthem&rdquo; does exist, and I think you&rsquo;d be happy enough with this one. This song takes the word &ldquo;Karma&rdquo; for what it is - pop culture nowadays tends to associate karma with bad consequences, but in Swift&rsquo;s perspective, it is simply a reflection of your own doing. She keeps the side of her street clean, therefore, karma is a cat purring in her lap because it loves her. (Did you realize who &ldquo;Spider Boy&rdquo; is about? Hint: The initials&hellip; Yeah, she&rsquo;s clever)</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="6-youre-losing-me-from-the-vault">6. You&rsquo;re Losing Me (From The Vault)<a href="#6-youre-losing-me-from-the-vault" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This song is not on any streaming services at the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah yes. The vault track that made me spent 5.99 just to get it. Totally worth the money though. I think that this song gives <em>Midnights</em> a new life. There are a lot of songs with a brand new perspective now that this song is released. Maybe this is a breakup album in disguise all along. <em>&ldquo;How long could we be a sad song,
&lsquo;Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?&rdquo;</em> OUCH.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="5-question">5. Question&hellip;?<a href="#5-question" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxrf_QBD5DE" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Question&hellip;?&rdquo; may not be everyone&rsquo;s favorite, but if it&rsquo;s yours, you&rsquo;re someone with an amazing music taste. Stuck between the fan favorite &ldquo;Midnight Rain&rdquo; and the hot topic &ldquo;Vigilante Shit&rdquo;, this song often gets overlooked. However, it is a good song - &ldquo;<em>Good girl, sad boy, big city, wrong choices</em>&rdquo; is one of her most descriptive (and effective) lyrics to date. The chorus sounds like an intervention, with Taylor asking the &ldquo;question&rdquo; to an unknown recipient. The &ldquo;&hellip;?&rdquo; in the title is also clever because I feel like those &ldquo;questions&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t really questions; instead, it&rsquo;s Swift trying to get her closure.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-maroon">4. Maroon<a href="#4-maroon" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Maroon&rdquo; being on Top 5 is pretty self-explanatory. It is, sonically and lyrically, an older, more mature sister of &ldquo;Red&rdquo;. One thing about this track is the usage of all the &ldquo;reds&rdquo; in the chorus. It&rsquo;s an amazing experience first time listening to the song with the lyrics, I can see it becoming one of the underrated deep-cuts on this album.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-midnight-rain">3. Midnight Rain<a href="#3-midnight-rain" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Midnight Rain&rdquo; captures the essence of the album - sleepless nights, the past that haunts oneself, lying awake in regret and turmoil. The pitched-down vocal effect also gives the song a nice touch - almost as if you&rsquo;re dreaming. It has quickly become a fan favorite upon release, and now the fans are wondering if she&rsquo;ll ever make this a single - guess we&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>If The Great War has a million fans, then I&rsquo;m one of them. If The Great War has one fan, then I&rsquo;m THAT ONE. If The Great War has no fans, that means I&rsquo;m dead. &ldquo;The Great War&rdquo; is a song about her past trauma and insecurity getting in the way of an amazing relationship. The abundance of World War I imagery and the metaphors made this song the best she&rsquo;s ever written. It&rsquo;s also rare to see her take responsibility in a song about relationships. The bridge still gives me chills to this day - &ldquo;<em>It turned into something bigger, somewhere in the haze, got a sense I&rsquo;d been betrayed.</em>&rdquo; Referencing the opening track &ldquo;Lavender Haze&rdquo;&hellip; She&rsquo;s truly the mastermind.</p>

<p>As the opening track on the album, &ldquo;Lavender Haze&rdquo; did an amazing job to intrigue the listeners and set the tone for the album. With a catchy beat (Thanks to the new producers) and the dreamy falsetto in the chorus, this song would be an amazing single, and it&rsquo;s so far the song with the most replay value on the album. I can&rsquo;t wait to see her venture into this sound and make an album out of it.</p>
