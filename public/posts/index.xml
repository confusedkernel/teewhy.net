      <content>&lt;p&gt;As the final week approaches, I find myself spending more time in a library or a cafe studying. As a music addict, I wasted quite a lot of time going through my music collection trying to find the type of music that works for me as I study. After wasing too much time browsing my saved albums, I decided to branch out and discover new album and artists that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably like. And this is the five album that I discovered and absolutely adored. If you&amp;rsquo;re someone like me, I hope these five energetic album can help you power through your exam week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nothing-lasts-forever-and-thats-ok---blanks-2022&#34;&gt;Nothing Lasts Forever and That&amp;rsquo;s OK - Blanks (2022)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/nothing-lasts-forever-and-thats-ok-deluxe/1631158475&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I first discovered Blanks in 2019, back when he was blowing up for his YouTube series &amp;ldquo;Remaking Songs in 1 Hour&amp;rdquo;. I remember thinking that he&amp;rsquo;d be the one to watch in the future. I stumbled upon his new album when I was shuffling through my library and found his old works. Out of curiosity I decided to check out his new album. Overall this album showed an incredible artistic growth, it&amp;rsquo;s still very pop/indie pop. But it&amp;rsquo;s a more matured, more cohesive, and more enjoyable project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt; : Asking For Too Much, Turn Around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fever-dream---cannons-2022&#34;&gt;Fever Dream - Cannons (2022)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/fever-dream/1609678268&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fever Dream&lt;/em&gt; is a sonic tapestry that weaves together elements of alternative rock, electronic music, and dream pop, resulting in a unique and evocative sound. Bearing similarity to Cannons&amp;rsquo; previous works, this album managed to keep her signature sound while still feeling fresh. The album overall has a hypnotic sound, with heavy reverb and a groove to it. I love coding to this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Bad Dream, Only You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calico---ryan-beatty-2023&#34;&gt;Calico - Ryan Beatty (2023)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/calico/1676552614&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the oddity out of these five albums. This album doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature a fabulous pop production or a punchy bassline, but it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up to become one of my favorite album in 2023. In contrast to other albums on this list, this album is soft. It gives off singer/songwriter vibe with Ryan Beatty&amp;rsquo;s raw vocals drawing you in with emotions. Overall, this album feels like an afternoon trip to your favorite coffee shop, just studying by the window as people walk by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Bruises Off The Peach, Andromeda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;that-feels-good---jessie-ware-2023&#34;&gt;That! Feels! Good! - Jessie Ware (2023)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/that-feels-good/1668868373&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Continuing the triumph of her last album &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Your Pleasure&lt;/em&gt; (which is also REALLY GOOD), this album continues the groovy, funky sound of that album. This album feels really old school - like an old school dance hall. Whenever it starts playing it&amp;rsquo;ll brighten up your day. Granted, this may not be the best album for studying, but it might just be what you need when you&amp;rsquo;re battling a bug-ridden program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Free Yourself, Begin Again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dreamland---coin-2020&#34;&gt;Dreamland - COIN (2020)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/dreamland/1485768225&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Better late than never I guess. In 2020, I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to &amp;ldquo;I Want It All&amp;rdquo; on repeat. I was obsessed with the synth-driven, funky chorus of the track. Little did I know this is an album full of that sound (and feel). If you&amp;rsquo;re someone into indie pop, this album is the lofi, chill vibes of indie pop at its finest. It&amp;rsquo;s upbeat with actually well-written verses. The album also feels somewhat nostalgic, like looking through a summer day in a film camera (iykyk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Track&lt;/strong&gt;: Simple Romance, Youuu&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I think that fortune and misfortune are always balanced in life. With each occurrence of an unfortunate event, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be something lucky happening soon. And this is sort of what happened today. As much as today&amp;rsquo;s event traumatized me, I find it funny (educational, even.) So, I decided to post it. (After all, this is what blogs are for, right?)
THE BIRDSTRIKE This afternoon I was doing my orienteering assignment in the park.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I think that fortune and misfortune are always balanced in life. With each occurrence of an unfortunate event, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be something lucky happening soon. And this is sort of what happened today. As much as today&amp;rsquo;s event traumatized me, I find it funny (educational, even.) So, I decided to post it. (After all, this is what blogs are for, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-birdstrike&#34;&gt;THE BIRDSTRIKE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I was doing my orienteering assignment in the park. As I rode my bike past the trees, a sudden wind brought &lt;strong&gt;a chunk of bird droppings&lt;/strong&gt; hit me right on my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As any hygienic person would do, I biked back to the public restroom, rushed into the accessible toilet, and took my shirt off. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize at the time was that I was wearing a T-shirt, and the bird droppings were dangerously close to the cuff. So, as I took my shirt off, the bird droppings moved and &lt;strong&gt;smudged onto my forearm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let out the loudest gag you&amp;rsquo;ll ever hear in a public restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I frantically rushed to the sink to try and wash two things at once (my shirt and now my forearm), my phone started vibrating in my pocket. In fear of it being some family emergency, I took out my phone (with my clean hand) and realized it was an unknown number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-start-of-an-unfortunate-event&#34;&gt;THE START OF AN UNFORTUNATE EVENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huh, this is even weirder,&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself. People seldom call me nowadays. Usually, if it&amp;rsquo;s an unknown number, the spam call warning would show up, and it almost always is a scam call. Not this time, though. Nothing indicated that the call was a scam call, just a bunch of unknown numbers staring back at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was the first mistake I made today. That call was from an interviewer from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello? This is Microsoft speaking. Are you available for an interview right now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, a sane person with bird droppings on both their arm and their shirt would say no. But in a wave of pure panic, I thought, how hard could it be? It&amp;rsquo;s just bird droppings. I only need to go to the sink, open the faucet, let the water run for a bit, and wash it while I talk. That seems alright to me&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy was I wrong about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was the second mistake I made today. I cannot, in fact, let the water run for a bit. It was an automatic faucet. The kind that you&amp;rsquo;d have to keep your hand under for it to work. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used one of those faucets, you&amp;rsquo;d know that it is almost impossible to keep it running. Even with your hand directly under it, it seemed so sensitive that as soon as your hand moved an inch, it would shut off. So I had to get my left arm under the sink (as I still had droppings on my arm to clean) and my right hand to squeeze as much handwash as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either by pure happenstance or an intricate plan schemed by higher powers, my AirPods died at that exact moment. So there I was, with both hands occupied and no way to talk to the interviewer. In retrospect, the number of things that went wrong was hilarious, but at the moment I sure didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was funny. I contemplated changing my mind and telling them that I was not actually free at the moment. But wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be weird to do so? Plus, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the one to back down from challenges, it seemed like the only option was to get my hands clean and pick up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-interview&#34;&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like what everyone said, the first phone interview would be simple. It lasts about five to ten minutes, and the questions range from simple self-introductions to inquiries about your resume. At first, the interviewer asks you to do a &lt;strong&gt;self-introduction&lt;/strong&gt; for about one minute. And there was my third mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m an Aries.&amp;rdquo; - Tyler (2023)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if mentioning one&amp;rsquo;s zodiac sign is a good idea. I think in my case it probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I wanted to say that I am an enthusiastic person about my hobbies, and coding happened to be my aspiration and interest. Therefore, I have a lot of motivation to strive for the better. I said none of those things. To compensate for my mistake so early on in the interview, I started talking about the professional aspect of myself, how I am organized and I love doing hobby projects for me during my free time. I guess it turned out alright. Now, I hope that my English skills are good enough to make up for the mistakes I made during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the interview is about your previous work experience and what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned. I go through my past experiences and what I learned from them smoothly&amp;hellip; until I get a phone call and &lt;strong&gt;accidentally hang up on both of them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO DOES THAT IN AN INTERVIEW?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, my friend would scold me for it, saying that it made no sense for me to do that because if I were in an in-person interview, these kinds of things wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to happen. And he would be right about it. It&amp;rsquo;s a mistake that probably should&amp;rsquo;ve never happened, and I hope that considering my circumstances, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be such a bad thing. (Dear Microsoft, I promise I am a lot brighter than this interview, please give me a chance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and last part of the interview is about your experiences with different programming languages and some applications of those languages. At this point, I was panicking to the brink of breaking down, but I wanted the job, so I tried my best to stay calm. In addition, my shirt is finally clean enough for me to put it back on, so it eased my mind a little. I went through my projects and named C and Rust two of my most familiar languages. After that, the interviewer ended the interview by saying that they&amp;rsquo;ll be in touch, and I got out of the bathroom with regrets and a soaked shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reflection&#34;&gt;THE REFLECTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the most valuable lesson I learned today is that decision-making is especially important during a panic. The art of making a rational decision even if you&amp;rsquo;re panicking on the inside is important. To understand your limits and make decisions accordingly, so that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t embarrass yourself as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thought about ways I could save the interview, perhaps by starting with ignoring all calls, even if it&amp;rsquo;s an emergency. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it looked from the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, but if you&amp;rsquo;re the interviewer and you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I&amp;rsquo;m sincerely sorry for the trouble I caused. (Disconnecting the call for a whole minute.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I would say that I did my best considering the dire situation I was in (I just got attacked by a random bird.) And I hope that none of you have to go through what I did in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
