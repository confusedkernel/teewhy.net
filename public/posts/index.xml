      <content>&lt;p&gt;As the final week approaches, I find myself spending more time in a library or a cafe studying. As a music addict, I wasted quite a lot of time going through my music collection trying to find the type of music that works for me as I study. After wasing too much time browsing my saved albums, I decided to branch out and discover new album and artists that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably like. And this is the five album that I discovered and absolutely adored. If you&amp;rsquo;re someone like me, I hope these five energetic album can help you power through your exam week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nothing-lasts-forever-and-thats-ok---blanks-2022&#34;&gt;Nothing Lasts Forever and That&amp;rsquo;s OK - Blanks (2022)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/nothing-lasts-forever-and-thats-ok-deluxe/1631158475&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I first discovered Blanks in 2019, back when he was blowing up for his YouTube series &amp;ldquo;Remaking Songs in 1 Hour&amp;rdquo;. I remember thinking that he&amp;rsquo;d be the one to watch in the future. I stumbled upon his new album when I was shuffling through my library and found his old works. Out of curiosity I decided to check out his new album. Overall this album showed an incredible artistic growth, it&amp;rsquo;s still very pop/indie pop. But it&amp;rsquo;s a more matured, more cohesive, and more enjoyable project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt; : Asking For Too Much, Turn Around&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fever-dream---cannons-2022&#34;&gt;Fever Dream - Cannons (2022)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/fever-dream/1609678268&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fever Dream&lt;/em&gt; is a sonic tapestry that weaves together elements of alternative rock, electronic music, and dream pop, resulting in a unique and evocative sound. Bearing similarity to Cannons&amp;rsquo; previous works, this album managed to keep her signature sound while still feeling fresh. The album overall has a hypnotic sound, with heavy reverb and a groove to it. I love coding to this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Bad Dream, Only You&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calico---ryan-beatty-2023&#34;&gt;Calico - Ryan Beatty (2023)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/calico/1676552614&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the oddity out of these five albums. This album doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature a fabulous pop production or a punchy bassline, but it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up to become one of my favorite album in 2023. In contrast to other albums on this list, this album is soft. It gives off singer/songwriter vibe with Ryan Beatty&amp;rsquo;s raw vocals drawing you in with emotions. Overall, this album feels like an afternoon trip to your favorite coffee shop, just studying by the window as people walk by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Bruises Off The Peach, Andromeda&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;that-feels-good---jessie-ware-2023&#34;&gt;That! Feels! Good! - Jessie Ware (2023)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/that-feels-good/1668868373&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Continuing the triumph of her last album &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Your Pleasure&lt;/em&gt; (which is also REALLY GOOD), this album continues the groovy, funky sound of that album. This album feels really old school - like an old school dance hall. Whenever it starts playing it&amp;rsquo;ll brighten up your day. Granted, this may not be the best album for studying, but it might just be what you need when you&amp;rsquo;re battling a bug-ridden program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Tracks&lt;/strong&gt;: Free Yourself, Begin Again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dreamland---coin-2020&#34;&gt;Dreamland - COIN (2020)&lt;/h2&gt;







    
    


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/dreamland/1485768225&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; height=&#34;450&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;max-width:800px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;&#34; sandbox=&#34;allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Better late than never I guess. In 2020, I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to &amp;ldquo;I Want It All&amp;rdquo; on repeat. I was obsessed with the synth-driven, funky chorus of the track. Little did I know this is an album full of that sound (and feel). If you&amp;rsquo;re someone into indie pop, this album is the lofi, chill vibes of indie pop at its finest. It&amp;rsquo;s upbeat with actually well-written verses. The album also feels somewhat nostalgic, like looking through a summer day in a film camera (iykyk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Track&lt;/strong&gt;: Simple Romance, Youuu&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Day in Life</title>

      <description>I think that fortune and misfortune are always balanced in life. With each occurrence of an unfortunate event, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be something lucky happening soon. And this is sort of what happened today. As much as today&amp;rsquo;s event traumatized me, I find it funny (educational, even.) So, I decided to post it. (After all, this is what blogs are for, right?)
THE BIRDSTRIKE This afternoon I was doing my orienteering assignment in the park.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I think that fortune and misfortune are always balanced in life. With each occurrence of an unfortunate event, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be something lucky happening soon. And this is sort of what happened today. As much as today&amp;rsquo;s event traumatized me, I find it funny (educational, even.) So, I decided to post it. (After all, this is what blogs are for, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-birdstrike&#34;&gt;THE BIRDSTRIKE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon I was doing my orienteering assignment in the park. As I rode my bike past the trees, a sudden wind brought &lt;strong&gt;a chunk of bird droppings&lt;/strong&gt; hit me right on my sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As any hygienic person would do, I biked back to the public restroom, rushed into the accessible toilet, and took my shirt off. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize at the time was that I was wearing a T-shirt, and the bird droppings were dangerously close to the cuff. So, as I took my shirt off, the bird droppings moved and &lt;strong&gt;smudged onto my forearm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let out the loudest gag you&amp;rsquo;ll ever hear in a public restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I frantically rushed to the sink to try and wash two things at once (my shirt and now my forearm), my phone started vibrating in my pocket. In fear of it being some family emergency, I took out my phone (with my clean hand) and realized it was an unknown number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-start-of-an-unfortunate-event&#34;&gt;THE START OF AN UNFORTUNATE EVENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Huh, this is even weirder,&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself. People seldom call me nowadays. Usually, if it&amp;rsquo;s an unknown number, the spam call warning would show up, and it almost always is a scam call. Not this time, though. Nothing indicated that the call was a scam call, just a bunch of unknown numbers staring back at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was the first mistake I made today. That call was from an interviewer from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello? This is Microsoft speaking. Are you available for an interview right now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, a sane person with bird droppings on both their arm and their shirt would say no. But in a wave of pure panic, I thought, how hard could it be? It&amp;rsquo;s just bird droppings. I only need to go to the sink, open the faucet, let the water run for a bit, and wash it while I talk. That seems alright to me&amp;hellip;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boy was I wrong about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was the second mistake I made today. I cannot, in fact, let the water run for a bit. It was an automatic faucet. The kind that you&amp;rsquo;d have to keep your hand under for it to work. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used one of those faucets, you&amp;rsquo;d know that it is almost impossible to keep it running. Even with your hand directly under it, it seemed so sensitive that as soon as your hand moved an inch, it would shut off. So I had to get my left arm under the sink (as I still had droppings on my arm to clean) and my right hand to squeeze as much handwash as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either by pure happenstance or an intricate plan schemed by higher powers, my AirPods died at that exact moment. So there I was, with both hands occupied and no way to talk to the interviewer. In retrospect, the number of things that went wrong was hilarious, but at the moment I sure didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was funny. I contemplated changing my mind and telling them that I was not actually free at the moment. But wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be weird to do so? Plus, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the one to back down from challenges, it seemed like the only option was to get my hands clean and pick up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-interview&#34;&gt;THE INTERVIEW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like what everyone said, the first phone interview would be simple. It lasts about five to ten minutes, and the questions range from simple self-introductions to inquiries about your resume. At first, the interviewer asks you to do a &lt;strong&gt;self-introduction&lt;/strong&gt; for about one minute. And there was my third mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m an Aries.&amp;rdquo; - Tyler (2023)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know if mentioning one&amp;rsquo;s zodiac sign is a good idea. I think in my case it probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I wanted to say that I am an enthusiastic person about my hobbies, and coding happened to be my aspiration and interest. Therefore, I have a lot of motivation to strive for the better. I said none of those things. To compensate for my mistake so early on in the interview, I started talking about the professional aspect of myself, how I am organized and I love doing hobby projects for me during my free time. I guess it turned out alright. Now, I hope that my English skills are good enough to make up for the mistakes I made during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the interview is about your previous work experience and what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned. I go through my past experiences and what I learned from them smoothly&amp;hellip; until I get a phone call and &lt;strong&gt;accidentally hang up on both of them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO DOES THAT IN AN INTERVIEW?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterward, my friend would scold me for it, saying that it made no sense for me to do that because if I were in an in-person interview, these kinds of things wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to happen. And he would be right about it. It&amp;rsquo;s a mistake that probably should&amp;rsquo;ve never happened, and I hope that considering my circumstances, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be such a bad thing. (Dear Microsoft, I promise I am a lot brighter than this interview, please give me a chance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and last part of the interview is about your experiences with different programming languages and some applications of those languages. At this point, I was panicking to the brink of breaking down, but I wanted the job, so I tried my best to stay calm. In addition, my shirt is finally clean enough for me to put it back on, so it eased my mind a little. I went through my projects and named C and Rust two of my most familiar languages. After that, the interviewer ended the interview by saying that they&amp;rsquo;ll be in touch, and I got out of the bathroom with regrets and a soaked shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reflection&#34;&gt;THE REFLECTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the most valuable lesson I learned today is that decision-making is especially important during a panic. The art of making a rational decision even if you&amp;rsquo;re panicking on the inside is important. To understand your limits and make decisions accordingly, so that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t embarrass yourself as much as I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also thought about ways I could save the interview, perhaps by starting with ignoring all calls, even if it&amp;rsquo;s an emergency. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how it looked from the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s perspective, but if you&amp;rsquo;re the interviewer and you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I&amp;rsquo;m sincerely sorry for the trouble I caused. (Disconnecting the call for a whole minute.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I would say that I did my best considering the dire situation I was in (I just got attacked by a random bird.) And I hope that none of you have to go through what I did in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Midnights by Taylor Swift: Ranked</title>
      <link>http://www.teewhy.net/posts/midnights-ranked/</link>

      <description>On October 21st, 2022, Taylor Swift dropped her highly-anticipated 10th studio album. After a near radio-silence year with very few contents, I was really excited for this album. And frankly speaking, this album did not disappoint. Overall this album encapsulates the concept of &amp;ldquo;13 Sleepless Nights,&amp;rdquo; and each song has a certain sound that corresponds to her &amp;ldquo;eras.&amp;rdquo; That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting the album on repeat for months and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to rank the tracks at all&amp;hellip; until now.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;On October 21st, 2022, Taylor Swift dropped her highly-anticipated 10th studio album. After a near radio-silence year with very few contents, I was really excited for this album. And frankly speaking, this album did not disappoint. Overall this album encapsulates the concept of &amp;ldquo;13 Sleepless Nights,&amp;rdquo; and each song has a certain sound that corresponds to her &amp;ldquo;eras.&amp;rdquo; That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting the album on repeat for months and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to rank the tracks at all&amp;hellip; until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2023.06.08&lt;/strong&gt;: A lot has happened since I first wrote this on my old website, therefore, I decided to include new tracks that just dropped a few days ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;24-paris&#34;&gt;24. Paris&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySZGZrcqvr4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why this track is on the album. It does not fit the theme and sonically it is the weakest song on the album. I think this track is another love letter to her current (update: they broke up) boyfriend Joe Alwyn. While it has some lyrical highlights, as well as the viral meme-ified lyrics &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tom pdom pdem alleyways&amp;rdquo; (Stumble down pretend alleyways)&lt;/em&gt;, it falls short when compared to other songs such as Lover, Delicate, or even some other tracks on this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;23-sweet-nothing&#34;&gt;23. Sweet Nothing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn0brgg2BpI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that I just hate happy songs (maybe I am). But &lt;em&gt;Sweet Nothing&lt;/em&gt;, yet another track dedicated to her boyfriend (who once again appeared in songwriting credits as William Bowery, served as the quiet, intimate ballad of the album. In this track, Taylor described the security and privacy she found in her relationship. It&amp;rsquo;s not a bad song, but the majority of the album outshines this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2023.06.08&lt;/strong&gt;: This song did not age well at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-glitch&#34;&gt;22. Glitch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2a73EvnZ4s&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Swift&amp;rsquo;s shortest song in her catalog, &lt;em&gt;Glitch&lt;/em&gt; is a track that received mixed reviews on the album. On first listen, the arrangement of the track could give people whiplash. While it did grow on me after a few listens, it has aged badly for me. Its lyrics are not remarkable (though still better than 90% of the pop songs), and the production sees Taylor Swift experimenting in a new subgenre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-mastermind&#34;&gt;21. Mastermind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmz1lz0zcLQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIP to &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; - (Paper Rings, 2019). In the closing track of &lt;em&gt;Midnights&lt;/em&gt;, Swift confesses that nothing about their relationship was accidental. She is the mastermind behind all of it. The song then took an unexpected plot twist at the end - &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Saw a wide smirk on your face, you knew the entire time. You knew that I&amp;rsquo;m a mastermind.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20-karma-ft-ice-spice&#34;&gt;20. Karma ft. Ice Spice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XzOvgu3GPwY&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a bad song, but the new beat on the second verse makes the song feel like it&amp;rsquo; less energetic than it should have been. I still love the remix part and genrally loved Ice Spice&amp;rsquo;s energy on this track, but I think it would&amp;rsquo;ve been so much better if they had just sticked with the original beat. Also, can we talk about the first lyrics? &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Karma is that girl like&amp;hellip; Grrah.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; So unserious, I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little ranking has more lines than Lana Del Rey&amp;rsquo;s entire verse on this song. I have to complain about this one because their voice blends beautifully, yet in another Swift fashion, Lana Del Rey got the backing vocals treatment on &lt;em&gt;Snow on the Beach&lt;/em&gt;. And now I&amp;rsquo;m just left wondering about what would&amp;rsquo;ve, could&amp;rsquo;ve, should&amp;rsquo;ve been. (Shout out to Dylan O&amp;rsquo;Brien for the drums though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song gives me mixed feelings. I think this is a track that would&amp;rsquo;ve been amazing on her folk projects such as &lt;em&gt;evermore&lt;/em&gt;, embracing the heavy infidelity theme of the album&amp;hellip; But as a bonus track on the pop record - it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit as much as it would&amp;rsquo;ve. There are tracks that are a lot stronger than &lt;em&gt;High Infidelity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor Swift unleashes her &amp;ldquo;reputation&amp;rdquo; persona on this track and gives us a glimpse of what&amp;rsquo;s to come in the &lt;em&gt;Reputation (Taylor&amp;rsquo;s Version)&lt;/em&gt; vault tracks. This track sounds like a twin sister to her 2017 hit &lt;em&gt;Look What You Made Me Do&lt;/em&gt;, but more violent and vengeful. Its minimal production is well-executed, and the lyrics hit her adversary in every spot that hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;16-snow-on-the-beach-ft-more-lana-del-rey&#34;&gt;16. Snow on the Beach ft. More Lana Del Rey&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No words. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything else to say. Lana Del Rey is truly the artist you&amp;rsquo;ll see once in a lifetime. If you get it, you get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;15-bejeweled&#34;&gt;15. Bejeweled&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now. This song truly feels like a throwback to her sleepless nights. This is her &amp;ldquo;glitter gel pen&amp;rdquo; at its prime. The lyrics are fun yet sophisticated (unlike a certain lead single on her 7th studio album&amp;hellip;) This song gives off &lt;em&gt;1989&lt;/em&gt; vibes and it feels like a more confident version of the &lt;em&gt;folklore&lt;/em&gt; track &amp;ldquo;mirrorball&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Best believe I&amp;rsquo;m still bejeweled, when I walk in a room, I can still make the whole place shimmer.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; Yes you absolutely can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;14-bigger-than-the-whole-sky&#34;&gt;14. Bigger Than The Whole Sky&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song is officially the saddest song she has ever written. &amp;ldquo;Bigger Than The Whole Sky&amp;rdquo; talks about grief and losing something very precious to you. The greatest thing about her songwriting is that even though everyone had a different story, they all relate to this song and use it as a way to express their feelings. The best (and most heart-breaking) line happens in the second verse, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Did some bird flap its wing over in Asia? Did some force take you because I didn&amp;rsquo;t pray?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song that was Target Exclusive for six months are finally available on streaming platforms. Honestly, just like Paris, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this track is on this album, but the catchy hook, the clever lyrics makes up for the oddity in the production. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I pictured you with other girls in love, then threw up on the street.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; She is so real for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-dear-reader&#34;&gt;12. Dear Reader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dear Reader&amp;rdquo; is the most underrated track on the album. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t catchy at first listen, but it ages like a fine wine with every listen. It is by far her best closing track, and the lyrics are top tier. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Never take advice from someone who&amp;rsquo;s falling apart.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; combined with the auto-tune to insinuate that she hides away her broken self. I adore this song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11-labyrinth&#34;&gt;11. Labyrinth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Labyrinth&amp;rdquo; is a very interesting song. It&amp;rsquo;s not as catchy as the other tracks, but it&amp;rsquo;s a highlight of the album nonetheless. One thing that I admire about this track is the way Swift tweaks the same line to represent feelings of falling in love - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Uh oh, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; shows the surprise and the realization; &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Oh no, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love again.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; illustrates the fear of falling in love; and finally, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m falling in love.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; feels like acceptance and knowing that it&amp;rsquo;ll be different this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-wouldve-couldve-shouldve&#34;&gt;10. Would&amp;rsquo;ve, Could&amp;rsquo;ve, Should&amp;rsquo;ve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You think Jake Gyllenhaal had it bad during &lt;em&gt;Red (Taylor&amp;rsquo;s Version)&lt;/em&gt;? Wait until you hear this track. Fans have been speculating that this song is about her infamous ex John Mayer. The &lt;em&gt;Speak Now&lt;/em&gt; production of this track further cemented Swiftie&amp;rsquo;s theory. In my opinion, this is a much more gut-wrenching song than &amp;ldquo;All Too Well&amp;rdquo;, and the lyrics were genius. Even though the title was &amp;ldquo;Would&amp;rsquo;ve, Could&amp;rsquo;ve, Should&amp;rsquo;ve&amp;rdquo;, she did not sing &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rsquo;ve&amp;rdquo; at all during the chorus - because she sang them all in the &lt;em&gt;Speak Now&lt;/em&gt; fan favorite &amp;ldquo;Dear John.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-youre-on-your-own-kid&#34;&gt;9. You&amp;rsquo;re on Your Own, Kid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels familiar? Taylor Swift had already hinted the track title during her NYU commencement speech in May. This is not the saddest track 5 in Taylor&amp;rsquo;s discography. Yet it is her most prolific track 5 ever. In &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re on Your Own, Kid&amp;rdquo;, Taylor talks about her past, hardships, and a hopeful attitude towards the future. The best thing about this song is the way she used the same phrase, yet the meaning of it is the polar opposite. Have a listen, and you&amp;rsquo;ll understand what I meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-anti-hero&#34;&gt;8. Anti-Hero&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This song is for the depressed kids who like to make fun of their own situation and dance to pop songs. &amp;ldquo;Anti-Hero&amp;rdquo; sees Taylor Swift confess her own insecurity - from the lyrics &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby, and I&amp;rsquo;m a monster on the hill.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; to the infamous &amp;ldquo;fat&amp;rdquo; scene in the music video (it is totally valid and it isn&amp;rsquo;t fatphobic, by the way.) It&amp;rsquo;s a feel-good song sonically and a comforting song lyrically - who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a combo like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-karma&#34;&gt;7. Karma&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry to all the &amp;ldquo;Karma the scrapped album&amp;rdquo; truthers, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. But &amp;ldquo;Karma the ultimate pop anthem&amp;rdquo; does exist, and I think you&amp;rsquo;d be happy enough with this one. This song takes the word &amp;ldquo;Karma&amp;rdquo; for what it is - pop culture nowadays tends to associate karma with bad consequences, but in Swift&amp;rsquo;s perspective, it is simply a reflection of your own doing. She keeps the side of her street clean, therefore, karma is a cat purring in her lap because it loves her. (Did you realize who &amp;ldquo;Spider Boy&amp;rdquo; is about? Hint: The initials&amp;hellip; Yeah, she&amp;rsquo;s clever)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This song is not on any streaming services at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes. The vault track that made me spent 5.99 just to get it. Totally worth the money though. I think that this song gives &lt;em&gt;Midnights&lt;/em&gt; a new life. There are a lot of songs with a brand new perspective now that this song is released. Maybe this is a breakup album in disguise all along. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;How long could we be a sad song,
&amp;lsquo;Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; OUCH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-question&#34;&gt;5. Question&amp;hellip;?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Question&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo; may not be everyone&amp;rsquo;s favorite, but if it&amp;rsquo;s yours, you&amp;rsquo;re someone with an amazing music taste. Stuck between the fan favorite &amp;ldquo;Midnight Rain&amp;rdquo; and the hot topic &amp;ldquo;Vigilante Shit&amp;rdquo;, this song often gets overlooked. However, it is a good song - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Good girl, sad boy, big city, wrong choices&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is one of her most descriptive (and effective) lyrics to date. The chorus sounds like an intervention, with Taylor asking the &amp;ldquo;question&amp;rdquo; to an unknown recipient. The &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo; in the title is also clever because I feel like those &amp;ldquo;questions&amp;rdquo; aren&amp;rsquo;t really questions; instead, it&amp;rsquo;s Swift trying to get her closure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-maroon&#34;&gt;4. Maroon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maroon&amp;rdquo; being on Top 5 is pretty self-explanatory. It is, sonically and lyrically, an older, more mature sister of &amp;ldquo;Red&amp;rdquo;. One thing about this track is the usage of all the &amp;ldquo;reds&amp;rdquo; in the chorus. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing experience first time listening to the song with the lyrics, I can see it becoming one of the underrated deep-cuts on this album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-midnight-rain&#34;&gt;3. Midnight Rain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Midnight Rain&amp;rdquo; captures the essence of the album - sleepless nights, the past that haunts oneself, lying awake in regret and turmoil. The pitched-down vocal effect also gives the song a nice touch - almost as if you&amp;rsquo;re dreaming. It has quickly become a fan favorite upon release, and now the fans are wondering if she&amp;rsquo;ll ever make this a single - guess we&amp;rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-the-great-war&#34;&gt;2. The Great War&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If The Great War has a million fans, then I&amp;rsquo;m one of them. If The Great War has one fan, then I&amp;rsquo;m THAT ONE. If The Great War has no fans, that means I&amp;rsquo;m dead. &amp;ldquo;The Great War&amp;rdquo; is a song about her past trauma and insecurity getting in the way of an amazing relationship. The abundance of World War I imagery and the metaphors made this song the best she&amp;rsquo;s ever written. It&amp;rsquo;s also rare to see her take responsibility in a song about relationships. The bridge still gives me chills to this day - &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;It turned into something bigger, somewhere in the haze, got a sense I&amp;rsquo;d been betrayed.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; Referencing the opening track &amp;ldquo;Lavender Haze&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; She&amp;rsquo;s truly the mastermind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-lavender-haze&#34;&gt;1. Lavender Haze&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the opening track on the album, &amp;ldquo;Lavender Haze&amp;rdquo; did an amazing job to intrigue the listeners and set the tone for the album. With a catchy beat (Thanks to the new producers) and the dreamy falsetto in the chorus, this song would be an amazing single, and it&amp;rsquo;s so far the song with the most replay value on the album. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see her venture into this sound and make an album out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
